              On the morning of January 25th, 2020, the first case of novel coronavirus in Australia
              was confirmed by Victorian Health Authorities. With new rules and regulations implemented
              to try an contain the contagious virus, the lives of many has not been the same ever since.
              From remote learning to working from home, we have all experienced some level of hardship
              relative to our mental, physical, social or financial wellbeing.

                  <p>
                    Aside from being highly contagious, COVID-19 also presents delayed symptoms. On 
                    average, this means that it takes between 5â€“6 days for symptoms to appear, however,
                    this can extend up to 14 days. As a consequence, it becomes crucial for individuals 
                    to be tested as soon as they feel unwell.The graph on the right illustrates that the 
                    spike in COVID testing across Australia is in tandem with the number of active cases.

                  Looking at the history of Australia's active cases, we can see that there were three
                  major outbreaks which have occured: one at the start of April 2020, one at the middle 
                  of August 2020, and our worst one yet - one in late September 2021. With the possibility 
                  of another outbreak being highly likely, the creation of a COVID was in a race against time.

                Despite it still being in its early stages, Prime Minister Scott 
                Morrison announced that Australia would administer its first round of vaccinations for front
                line workers as well as seniors. Shortly following, the vaccines were made available for all
                individuals aged 40 and above. Ensuing the news of Pfizer-BioNTech being FDA approved as the
                first COVID vaccine, individuals aged 16 to 39 were eligible for a COVID vaccine from the 30th
                of August onwards.

                <h2>Severity of Symptoms</h2>
                <p>
                  Despite COVID being highly contagious, approximately only <span style="font-size: 15pt;"><b>15%</b></span>
                  of individuals experience moderate symptoms, and only <span style="font-size: 15pt;"><b>5%</b></span>
                  experience severe symptoms. These are usually older individuals aged 70 and above alongside those who possess 
                  chronic health conditions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  From the area chart on the right, we can see that the number of people who needed to go to 
                  hospital as a result of contracting COVID coincides with the pattern of the active case numbers.
                  Of those who do need medical attention, we can once again see that only a small proportion of these
                  individuals suffer from severe symptoms, thus need to either be in ICU or use a ventilator.

                  During the second outbreak in August 2020, the case fatality was approximately 
                  <span style="font-size: 15pt;"><b>4.9%</b></span>. However, with the administration of 
                  COVID vaccines starting on the 22nd of February, we can see that the fatality 
                  reduced down to <span style="font-size: 15pt;"><b>0.3%</b></span>, despite incurring all 
                  time high case records. These numbers likewise showcases the impact in which the vaccines 
                  are having on strengthening the body's immune system against COVID.

                <h2>Days in Lockdown</h2>
                <p>
                  On the 4th of October, Victoria made news headlines as being 
                  <span style="font-size: 15pt;"><b>'the most locked down city in the world'</b></span>.
                  Prior to the distribution of covid vaccines, premier Daniel Andrews adopted a 0-case 
                  strategy, whereby a lockdown would ensue given a spike in case numbers and only be lifted 
                  once these numbers hit 0.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Albeit this strategy worked in controlling the first two outbreaks, Mr. Andrews realised
                  that this strategy would be impractical given the massive surge in case numbers as of the
                  29th of September. Concurrently, Mr.Andrews has redirected the strategy to ending Victoria's
                  6th lockdown given that it reaches a double dose vaccination rate of 70%.
